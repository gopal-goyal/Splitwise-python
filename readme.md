-------------Hi Guys-----------

- Splitwise has limited 2 expensed to add in free version so I thought why not make my own personal splitwise lol.

- This is a simple splitwise app made using python which takes 4 inputs (description, amount, paid_by, participants) 
and gives the amounts owe and owed to each participant.
